Tasks:
1. Create a point with the coordinates (x, y). Write a reusable function (or class method) showing a point inside a circle, with radius R, centered on coordinates (0, 0).
2. Now, write a function to process an array of points.
3. How would you rewrite this code for a three-dimensional case (with 3 coordinates at the point: x,y,z and a sphere instead of the circle)?
4. Make an npm package with the necessary code. You donâ€™t have to publish it .
5. Make a new repository, init Vue.js application and connect a package.
6. Allow users to make a list of points that lay inside the sphere. They should be able to create a new group that identifies the radius of circle. Then they will add points to this group and the app will tell them which ones are suitable. Users can save or delete the point, If they save, the point must be in the group after a page reload. The group should be able to be saved, deleted, or edited.
